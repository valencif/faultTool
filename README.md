# FaultTool

The aim of this project is to create an open-source tool to analyse the vulnerability of circuit against fault attacks.

So far the tool implements the analysis against Fault Sensitivity Analysis (FSA).

## Getting Started

Every analysis is configured with the file **FSAConfig.txt**, where the needed files are and their paths are requested. 
To compile the code is enough with running **make all** in the console, and to create a documentation **make docs**. To run the analysis run in the console **./bin /FSA**.
