# FaultTool

The aim of this project is to create an open-source tool to analyse the vulnerability of circuit against fault attacks.

So far the tool implements the analysis against Fault Sensitivity Analysis (FSA).

## Getting Started

Every analysis is configured with the file **FSAConfig.txt**, where the needed files are and their paths are requested. First time it is recommended to activate flag **debug** to see the output of internal processes. All phases of the configuration file should be place at 0 start a process from the beginning.
To compile the code is enough with running **make all** in the console, and to create a documentation **make docs**. To run the analysis run in the console **./bin /FSA**.

The needed files are:

1. HDL description: The folder containing these files should be specified in the configuration file
   1. VHDL circuit: The specification of the module in vdhl code
   2. src.txt: list of the vhdl files starting from the smallest modules until the top level module. Every line should contain one filename.
1. TestBenches: The folder containing these files and their names should be specified in the configuration file
   1. Testbench for RTL level: This file should output *Testbench successful* or *Testbench fail*
   2. Testbench for gate level module
1. SW model: This files should be place in the folder *Templates*. The name of this software model class is the same name of the project. The class is specify in *.cpp* and *.h* files. The model is a c++ class inheriting from **ModelSW** and should inclcude **../src/ModelSW.h**. If error *cannot allocate abstract ...* appears is because the model in not implementing all functions of ModelSW.

Current version was tested in CentOS 7 for 64 bits. The environment was configure to use *c-shell*.
